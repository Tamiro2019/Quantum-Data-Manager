### A data managing system for simulations with quantum mechanical models

Computer simulations are an essential part of a quantum physicist's toolkit. Today physicists spend as much time, if not more,
in front of a computer as they do running experiments in a lab or writing equations on a chalk board. Programming and running 
complex simulations of realistic physical systems can be a slow time consuming process, and newcomers often waste a 
substantial amount of time trying to organize their output or continually re-running entire programs everytime a minor change is made. Therefore, it is key that they learn how to manage their output data quickly 
and seamlessly, freeing up time and mental space to analyze the physical implications of their results.
